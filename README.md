# Comparing Performance of Diﬀerent Goal Functionals in Solving PDEs Using Neural Networks

This is the complementary github repository to the bachelor thesis titled "Comparing Performance of Diﬀerent Goal Functionals in Solving PDEs Using Neural Networks".

The Jupyter Notebook `tests.ipynb` contains the complete code to perform every test described in the thesis and is written in a way to allow easy construction of own new tests.
In the Notebook `tables_and_figures.ipynb` you can find the code with wich all tables and figures of the thesis were created.

Inside the `logs` folder you find the raw data of all the tests which are mentioned in the thesis.
If you want to analyze the data yourself (for example with `tables_and_figures.ipynb`) you can simply clone the repository and upload the logs to your google drive.
