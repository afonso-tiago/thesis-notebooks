# Comparing Performance of Diﬀerent Goal Functionals in Solving PDEs Using Neural Networks

This is the complementary github repository to the bachelor thesis titled "*Comparing Performance of Diﬀerent Goal Functionals in Solving PDEs Using Neural Networks*".

The Jupyter notebook [tests.ipynb](https://github.com/afonso-tiago/thesis-notebooks/blob/main/tests.ipynb)
(<a href="https://colab.research.google.com/github/afonso-tiago/thesis-notebooks/blob/main/tests.ipynb" target="_parent">
<img src="https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg" alt="Open In Colab"/>
</a>)
contains the complete code to perform every test described in the thesis and is written in a way to allow easy construction of own new tests.
In the notebook [tables_and_figures.ipynb](https://github.com/afonso-tiago/thesis-notebooks/blob/main/tables_and_figures.ipynb)
(<a href="https://colab.research.google.com/github/afonso-tiago/thesis-notebooks/blob/main/tables_and_figures.ipynb" target="_parent">
<img src="https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg" alt="Open tables_and_figures.ipynb In Colab"/>
</a>),
you can find the code with which all tables and figures of the thesis were created.
Both notebooks are hosted in the Google Cloud as Colab notebooks and can thus be run directly in the browser.

Inside the [logs](https://github.com/afonso-tiago/thesis-notebooks/tree/main/logs) folder you find the raw data of all the tests which are mentioned in the thesis.
You can analyze the data yourself using for example the [tables_and_figures.ipynb](https://github.com/afonso-tiago/thesis-notebooks/blob/main/tables_and_figures.ipynb) notebook.
